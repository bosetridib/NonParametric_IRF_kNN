# Nonparametric impulse response function with kNN

This is the code for the working paper 'Nonparameteric impulse response analysis in changing macroeconomic conditions'. The nonparametric method used here is k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), which is a popular tool in machine learning. Execution of the file NonParametricIRF_Forecasting_GIRF.py is sufficient.
