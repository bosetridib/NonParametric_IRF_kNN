# Nonparametric impulse response function with kNN

This is the code for the working paper 'Nonparameteric impulse response analysis in changing macroeconomic conditions'. The nonparametric method used here is k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), which is a popular tool in machine learning. One can change the variable 'df' in NonParametricIRF_Data.py to perform the method on their chosen dataset. Execution of the file NonParametricIRF_Forecasting_GIRF.py is sufficient.
